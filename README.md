# refactoring-horiseon

## Description 

 This repo covers the refactoring of Horiseon's webpage using semantic html. The aim was to create a well-structured webpage which is optimized for search engines and has the functionality to support assistive technologies. HTML and CSS was used to complete this project. 
 
 Since, this was all new to me, I found it quite interesting to learn the importance of semantics and how it contributes to the site architecture. Particulary, how it separates presentation from content, making the site more readable to both humans and computers. Also, interesting is its contribution to improving accessibility, SEO, and maintenance.
